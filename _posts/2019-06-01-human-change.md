A personal interest of mine is measuring/modeling/visualizing psychological change/growth.  As part of a data mining course, I led a project exploring what we can learn from a long-running blog with NLP (Natural Language Processing) and linguistic analysis.  Data gathered myself with a custom crawler/scraper. [Overview Slides PDF](https://github.com/a-laughlin/data-mining-group/blob/master/Group2_TimeSeriesNLP_Part6.pdf). Code:[scrape/crawl]( https://github.com/a-laughlin/data-mining-group/blob/master/adam_scraper.js), [transform/clean](https://github.com/a-laughlin/data-mining-group/blob/master/adam_transform.py), [analysis notebook](https://github.com/a-laughlin/data-mining-group/blob/master/adam_analysis.ipynb)

Tech: Puppeteer+Node.js Crawler/Scraper. Python. Pandas. LIWC. spaCy. Skikit-learn.
