Project title linked to post exploring React with ROI-focused archecture optimizations.

[Related composable-react-architecture repo](https://github.com/a-laughlin/composable-react-architecture) from a couple of years ago exploring some earlier ideas of what the code might look. May eventually update it now that React Hooks enable a much cleaner and simpler implementation. Also needs unit/integration tests to show how they would work.  One thing at a time...

Tech in that example:  React, Redux, GraphQL, create-react-app (i.e., webpack).
