Need to link: In progress blog post ROI-focused architecture optimizations.

Maybe link: [Related composable-react-architecture repo from 2016/17](https://github.com/a-laughlin/composable-react-architecture). May eventually update it now that React Hooks enable a much cleaner and simpler implementation. Also needs unit/integration tests to show how they would work.  One thing at a time...

Tech in that example:  React, Redux, Recompose, GraphQL, create-react-app (i.e., webpack).
