cases:
Disconnected node list
  Create virtual root with out-edges to nodes. Treat as rooted out-tree. create virtual root. Go to rooted out-tree.
Undirected Graph
  direct edges to prevent cycles
  Can't prevent cycles (including back-edges)?
    Go to directed-cyclic-graph
  has root? Go to rooted-out-tree
  no root? Go to forest
directed-cyclic-graph
  Transform to rooted-out-tree with back edges?
  ... That's basically what redux does with RootReducer
  TBD.  State article will hit this.
forest (multi-rooted-out-trees):
  Create virtual root. Treat as rooted out-tree.
rooted-in-tree:
  add virtual root after leaves
  conceptually invert tree (root becomes single leaf)
  go to rooted-out-tree
2-graph operations:
  insert virtual root to transform 2 graphs to
  one rooted-out-tree
rooted-out-tree:
  no back edges
  operations:
    read root
    read intermediate
    read leaf
    insert node root
    insert node middle
    insert node leaf
    update root
    update middle
    update leaf
    remove root
    remove middle
    remove leaf
    insert edge root->internal
    insert edge root->leaf
    insert edge internal->internal
    insert edge internal->leaf
    insert forward-edge root->internal
    insert forward-edge root->leaf
    insert forward-edge internal->internal
    insert forward-edge internal->leaf
    insert cross-edge internal->internal
    insert cross-edge internal->leaf
